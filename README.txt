*NETWORK ACTIVITY INDICATOR

Network Activity Indicator is a handy swiss-knife tool for network administration and statistics.
Featuring an old-school but very missed blinking network status icon in the system tray, network traffic graph, and advanced network statistics.

It's the fork of GabNetStats application by GabSoftware (https://github.com/gabsoftware)

FEATURES
- Adds a blinking icon in the statusbar that reflects network traffic
- Blinking icon can show either the fact of sending/receiving some data during specified interval (2 level of icon brightness) or show the rate of sending/receiving data (6 levels of icon brightness or 6 different colors)
- Detailed statistics about network connections
- Context menu for easy access to network configuration
- Real-time network graph

NOTES
- .NET Framework 4.8 must be installed to use this application
- It's portable application. Unzip it to any folder and run "Network Activity Indicator.exe"
- Use one of "color" icon sets (see all icon sets inside "icons" folder of application) for "Only send/receive detection (blue icon)" visual effects
- Use any icon set for "bandwidth" (send/receive rate) visual effects
